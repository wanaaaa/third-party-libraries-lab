## Introduction


In this lab, you will be experimenting with a third party library of your choice from the list provided below. This will give you extra practice on how to read the documentation for libraries, understand what they do, and actually using them. There are many libraries out there, but this list includes some popular ones that accomplish a variety of different tasks.

The lab will be broken down into two sections:

1. Briefly go through the libraries listed below. Then choose one you want to use, and create a document that explains **in your own words** what the library does. Additionally, give an example of how the library might be used in an app.
2. Create an app that uses the library you chose. It's up to you to decide what the app does, the only requirement is that you use one of the libraries. If an example is given in the documentation, don't just copy that into your app!
